# FSP-USB from xortroll
This is used by DBI since version 130, it will only work on atmosphere. You need to decompress the zip file for your atmosphere version on your SD keeping the structure, once you do DBI will be able to see HDD drives on atmosphere on fat32 or exfat.

This sysmodule is being developped by Xortroll and is also supported by goldleaf beta.
